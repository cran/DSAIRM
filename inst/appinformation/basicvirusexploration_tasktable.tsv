Specifically, we can compute the steady states. You saw how that is done in the ___Basic Virus Model___ app. If this is unfamiliar to you or you need a refresher, (re)visit that app and go through the tasks. You found there (if you did the math) that the virus load at steady state is given by $V_s = (bnp-bd_Ign-d_Id_Ud_V)/bd_Id_V$. This equation suggests that as the rate at which infected cells produce virus increases, the virus load at steady state goes up, which you found above. It also suggests that the relation between virus load and the rate at which virus infects cell, *b*, is more complicated, since *b* shows up both in the numerator and denominator. If you have practice reading equations, you might be able to visualize how **V~s~** behaves as *b* is varied. You can always explore it numerically. Let's do that.


Set all parameters as previously, with _p_=5 and 300 days simulation time. Choose _b_ as the parameter to vary, between 1e-6 and 1e-3, do 20 different parameter values, log spacing for parameter values, and plot both axes on a logarithmic scale. Run the simulation. Observe the pattern you get for **V~s~** as a function of _b_ and see if it agrees with the equation (it should). 


We cannot compute similar mathematical expressions for the peak of the variables. In general, as soon as our model reaches a certain level of complexity (maybe around 5 equations and more), getting analytic/mathematical equations for most outcomes of interest is not possible and the numerical approach of running the simulations and looking at the results is the only option we have."

Choose _d~I~_ as the parameter to vary and set lower and upper limit to 0.25 and 5 and the number of samples to 20. Before you run the model, look at your equation for __V~s~__ and try to predict what you should see in the plot. Similarly, while you don't have an analytical solution, you can look at the model equations and try to intuit what you might expect __V~peak~__ and __I~peak~__ to do as you increase _d~I~_.

Note that here we focus on a single parameter at a time. With a little bit of coding effort, we could change the underlying simulation to loop over say 2 parameters and produce outcomes for sets of parameter values, e.g. _V~peak~_ as a function of _b_ and _p_. This can be done by writing 2 loops (or some equivalent way of doing it) to scan over various combinations of parameter values for _b_ and _p_ and run the simulation for each such combination and record the results. These results could be plotted as a 2-dimensional heatmap. While this could be extended to more than 2 parameters, it will become hard to visualize and long to run. If there are many parameters that could change, a different approach is useful, which you'll learn about in the ***Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analysis*** app."	"T5R1"	"Nothing"	"None"	""

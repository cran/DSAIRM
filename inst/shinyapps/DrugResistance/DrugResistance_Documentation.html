<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This app allows exploration of a stochastic model that simulates emergence of drug resistance during an acute virus infection (e.g. influenza) in the presence of an antiviral. Read about the model in the “Model” tab. Then do the tasks described in the “What to do” tab.</p>
</div>

<h2>The Model</h2>
<div id="model-description" class="section level3">
<h3>Model Description</h3>
<p>This model is a modification and extension of the model described in the “Model Stochasticity” app. Here, we track 2 types of virus, wild-type and drug sensitive, and a resistant mutant. We also consider the presence of a drug.</p>
<p>This model consists of 5 compartments:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>U</strong> - uninfected cells</li>
<li><strong>I_s</strong> - cells infected with drug sensitive virus</li>
<li><strong>I_r</strong> - cells infected with drug resistant virus</li>
<li><strong>V_s</strong> - drug-sensitive virus</li>
<li><strong>V_r</strong> - drug-resistant virus</li>
</ul>
<p>For this model, we consider the following processes:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Drug-sensitive or drug resistant Virus infects uninfect cells at (the same) rate <em>b</em>.</li>
<li>Drug-sensitive infected cells produce new drug-sensitive virus at rate <em>(1-m)p</em> and occasionally generate a resistant mutant virus at rate <em>mp</em>.</li>
<li>Drug-resistant infected cells produce new drug-resistant virus at rate <em>(1-f)p</em>. The factor <em>f</em> accounts for the cost of fitness generally observed for drug resistant strains.</li>
<li>Sensitive and resistant virus are both removed at rate <em>dV</em>, loss of virus due to infecting new cells is ignored.</li>
<li>A drug reduces production of sensitive virus by a factor <em>e</em>, it does not affect resistant virus.</li>
</ol>
<p>For simplicity, we ignore the possibility that a cell might be infected by both drug sensitive and infected virus and might produce a mix of them.</p>

<h3>Model Equations</h3>
<p><em>If</em> we were to implement this model as a continuous-time, deterministic model, it would have the following set of ordinary differential equations.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\dot U =  - bUV_s - bU V_r\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\dot I_s = bUV_s - d_I I_s\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\dot I_r = bUV_r - d_I I_r\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\dot V_s = (1-e)(1-m)pI_s - d_V V_s\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\dot V_r = (1-e)mpI_s + (1-f)pI_r - d_V V_r\]</span></p>
<p><em>However</em> we use a stochastic model here. For such a model, the differential equation formulation is not valid. One can write down an equivalent formulation as a stochastic model by specifying every possible process (also called transition/event/reaction) that can occur and their propensities (the propensity multiplied with the time step gives the probability that a given process/event/transition occurs). For our model these are the following:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Event type</th>
<th>Transitions</th>
<th>Propensity</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>drug sensitive infection</td>
<td>U =&gt; U-1, I_s =&gt; I_s + 1</td>
<td>b<em>U</em>V_s</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>drug resistant infection</td>
<td>U =&gt; U-1, I_r =&gt; I_r + 1</td>
<td>b<em>U</em>V_r</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>death if I_s</td>
<td>I_s =&gt; I_s - 1</td>
<td>dI*I_s</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>death if I_r</td>
<td>I_r =&gt; I_r - 1</td>
<td>dI*I_r</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>production of V_s</td>
<td>V_s =&gt; V_s + 1</td>
<td>(1-e)<em>(1-m)</em>p*I_s</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>removal of V_s</td>
<td>V_s =&gt; V_s - 1</td>
<td>dV*V_s</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>production of V_r</td>
<td>V_r =&gt; V_r + 1</td>
<td>(1-e)<em>m</em>p<em>I_s + (1-f)</em>p*I_r</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>removal of V_r</td>
<td>V_r =&gt; V_r - 1</td>
<td>dV*V_r</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<h2>What to do</h2>
<p>Note: For this simulation, you can set a random number seed. This ensures reproducibility. If you choose the same seed and run the simulation twice, the same random numbers are generated and you get the same trajectory. To get different results, you can change the random number seed. This is NOT a model parameter, just something that controls the randomness during the simulations.</p>
<div id="task-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Task 1:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Confirm that you get a single infection with sensitive virus with the default settings.</li>
<li>Set ‘resistant generation fraction’ to a small on-zero value. You should start seeing some resistant virus. Why is it it lower than the sensitive virus?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="task-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Task 2:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Set ‘resistant generation fraction’ to 0.01. Run simulation for different drug efficacy values. Observe how the magnitude of the <em>V<sub>s</sub></em> and <em>V<sub>r</sub></em> curves change and eventually for high enough drug efficacy, not infection takes place anymore.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="task-3" class="section level3">
<h3>Task 3:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Set drug efficacy to 0.4, everything else as before.</li>
<li>Run simulation for different values of resistant fitness cost. Observe how the magnitude of the <em>V<sub>s</sub></em> and <em>V<sub>r</sub></em> curves change.</li>
<li>Explore how different values for drug efficacy (which affects <em>V<sub>s</sub></em>) and fitness cost (which affects <em>V<sub>r</sub></em>) lead to different outcomes.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="task-4" class="section level3">
<h3>Task 4:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Repeat or continue your explorations with more than one stochastic simulation being run.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="shinytab4" class="section level2">
<h2>Further Information</h2>
<ul>
<li>The code running the model is in the function/script <code>simulate_drugresistance.R</code>. Check the help file for both functions to see how to use them.</li>
<li>The stochastic simulation is implemented using the <code>adaptivetau</code> package.</li>
<li>A very similar model was used and explored in <span class="citation">(Handel, Longini, and Antia 2007)</span>, a similar, more detailed one was analyzed in <span class="citation">(Canini et al. 2014)</span>.</li>

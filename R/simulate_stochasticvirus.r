#' Stochastic simulation of a compartmental acute virus infection model
#'
#' @description  Simulation of a stochastic model with the following compartments:
#' Uninfected target cells (U), Infected cells (I), virus (V).
#'
#' @param U0 initial number of target cells. Needs to be an integer.
#' @param I0 initial number of wild-type infected cells. Needs to be an integer.
#' @param V0 initial number of resistant virus. Needs to be an integer.
#' @param n rate of uninfected cell production
#' @param dU rate of uninfected cell removal
#' @param b level/rate of infection of cells
#' @param dI rate of infected cell death
#' @param p virus production rate
#' @param dV virus removal rate
#' @param rngseed seed for random number generator to allow reproducibility
#' @param tmax maximum simulation time, units depend on choice of units for your
#'   parameters
#' @return A list. The list has only one element called ts.
#' ts contains the time-series of the simulation.
#' The 1st column of ts is Time, the other columns are the model variables.
#' @details A compartmental ID model with several states/compartments
#' is simulated as a stochastic model using the adaptive tau algorithm as implemented by ssa.adaptivetau()
#' in the adaptivetau package. See the manual of this package for more details.
#' The function returns the time series of the simulated disease as output matrix,
#' with one column per compartment/variable. The first column is time.
#' @section Warning:
#' This function does not perform any error checking. So if you try to do
#' something nonsensical (e.g. have I0 > PopSize or any negative values or fractions > 1),
#' the code will likely abort with an error message.
#' @examples
#' # To run the simulation with default parameters just call the function:
#' result <- simulate_stochasticvirus()
#' # To choose parameter values other than the standard one, specify them, like such:
#' result <- simulate_stochasticvirus(tmax = 20, dI = 0.5)
#' # You should then use the simulation result returned from the function, like this:
#' plot(result$ts[,"Time"],result$ts[,"V"],xlab='Time',ylab='Virus',type='l')
#' @references See the manual for the adaptivetau package for details on the algorithm.
#'             See the app corresponding to this function in DSAIDE for more details on the model.

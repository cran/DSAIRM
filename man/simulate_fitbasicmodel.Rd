\value{
The function returns a list containing the best fit time series, the best fit parameters
the data and the final SSR
}
\description{
This function runs a simulation of a compartment model
using a set of ordinary differential equations.
The model describes a simple viral infection system.
}
\details{
A simple compartmental ODE model mimicking acute viral infection
is fitted to data.
Data can either be real or created by running the model with known parameters and using the simulated data to
determine if the model parameters can be identified
The fitting is done using solvers/optimizers from the nloptr package (which is a wrapper for the nlopt library).
The package provides access to a large number of solvers.
Here, we only implement 3 solvers, namely 1 = NLOPT_LN_COBYLA, 2 = NLOPT_LN_NELDERMEAD, 3 = NLOPT_LN_SBPLX
For details on what those optimizers are and how they work, see the nlopt/nloptr documentation.

\section{Warning}{
 This function does not perform any error checking. So if
  you try to do something nonsensical (e.g. specify negative parameter or starting values,
  the code will likely abort with an error message.

\examples{
# To run the code with default parameters just call the function:
\dontrun{result <- simulate_fitbasicmodel()}
# To apply different settings, provide them to the simulator function, like such:
result <- simulate_fitbasicmodel(iter = 5)

See the Shiny app documentation corresponding to this
function for more details on this model.

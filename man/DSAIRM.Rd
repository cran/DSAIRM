\title{DSAIRM: A package to learn about Dynamical Systems Approaches to
Immune Response Modeling}
\description{
This package provides a number of Shiny apps that simulate various
within-host infection and immune response dynamics models.
By manipulating the models and working
through the instructions provided within the Shiny UI, you can learn about
some important concepts in immune response modeling. You will also
learn how models can be used to study such concepts.

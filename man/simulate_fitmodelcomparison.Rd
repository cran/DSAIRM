\value{
The function returns a list containing the best fit timeseries,
the best fit parameters, the data and the AICc for the model.
}
\description{
This function runs a simulation of a compartment model
using a set of ordinary differential equations.
The model describes a simple viral infection system in the presence of drug treatment.
The user provides initial conditions and parameter values for the system.
The function simulates the ODE using an ODE solver from the deSolve package.
The function returns a matrix containing time-series of each variable and time.
}
\details{
Two simple compartmental ODE models mimicking acute viral infection
with T-cells (model 1) or antibodies (model 2) are fitted to data.
}
\section{Warning}{
 This function does not perform any error checking. So if
  you try to do something nonsensical (e.g. specify negative parameter or starting values),
  the code will likely abort with an error message.

\examples{
# To run the code with default parameters just call the function:
\dontrun{result <- simulate_fitmodelcomparison()}
# To apply different settings, provide them to the simulator function, like such:
result <- simulate_fitmodelcomparison(iter = 5)
result <- simulate_fitmodelcomparison(iter = 5, modeltype = 2)
}

See the Shiny app documentation corresponding to this
function for more details on this model.
